# CanBudget
  Budgeting can be difficult for everyone. 
  Most Canadians have credit cards and bank accounts with multiple institutions, making it difficult to keep track of everything on your own. 
  Our app aims to provide an intuitive solution for tracking and visualizing your finances. 
  From seasoned budgeters to financial freshman, CanBudget is accessible for everyone.

  This application was created in a project based learning environment for the EvolveU Full Stack Development Program - Cohort 6.
